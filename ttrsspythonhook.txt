TODO:
move pyqt4 application to main thread, pass in the systrayicon object to the polling process... or should we use shared memory? Probably use shared memory.

python 2.7
use pysfml http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
or wxpython http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable
reads in tokyotosho rss feed http://tokyotosho.info/rss.php?filter=1
able to search for specific releases by sub group or title (obviously multiple searches allowed)
store link to torrent
parses every 5-10 minutes (or more)
stores time of latest file
only looks at rss feed respones up until that time
pop up notification in systemtray when something matches the subgroup/title requested
keep .conf file
run on startup
etc.

mostly just a way to practice my coding skills and learn gui and what not. even though wxpython doesn't look great, it's not bad I suppose. Mostly using it for notification bubbles (at least thats what the internet tells me)
when parsing xml, only care about the name and torrent, and possibly a ddl link if provided
